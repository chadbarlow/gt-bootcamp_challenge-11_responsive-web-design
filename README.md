## Tools
* HTML and CSS
* Bootstrap
* Pandas 

## Features
* Responsive design, compatible with various screen sizes
* Navigation menu for easy access to different visualizations and data
* Four visualizations with dedicated pages and descriptions
* A comparison page to view all visualizations simultaneously
* A data page displaying a responsive table with the dataset used for the visualizations

## Limitations
* The dataset used is limited in scope and may not represent all possible latitudes and weather patterns
* The visualizations are static and do not support dynamic updates based on user input or real-time data

## Further Development
* Integrate additional datasets to expand the scope and coverage of the visualizations
* Implement interactive visualizations that allow users to manipulate variables and explore data in real-time
* Incorporate real-time data sources to keep visualizations current and relevant
* Enhance the dashboard with more advanced features, such as filtering and data download options
